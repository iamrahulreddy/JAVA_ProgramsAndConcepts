        //A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we first need to define the class.

        //We can create a class in Java using the class keyword
        //SYNTAX:
        class className {
            //fields
            //methods
        }
        //Here, fields (variables) and methods represent the state and behavior of the object respectively.
        //fields are used to store data
        //methods are used to perform some operations
        //Fields and methods of a class are also called members of the class.
