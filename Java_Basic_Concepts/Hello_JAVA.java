//Every JAVA Application Starts With Class Definition.
//The Name of the class must match with the file name in JAVA

// Every application in Java must contain the main method.
// The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.
//The main function is the entry point of our Java application, and it's mandatory in a Java program
