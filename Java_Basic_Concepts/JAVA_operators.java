        //In computer programming, operators are constructs defined within programming languages;
        // which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically.
        //Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

        //1. Java Arithmetic-Operators
        //Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data.
        // + - * / %
        //If we use the division operator with two integers, then the resulting quotient will also be an integer.
        // And, if one of the operands is a floating-point number, we will get the result will also be in floating-point.

        //2. Java Assignment operators
        //Assignment-operators are used in Java to assign values to variables.
        // = , += , -= , *= , /= , %=

        //3. Java Relational-Operators
        //Relational operators are used to check the relationship between two operands.
        //It returns either true or false.
        //Relational operators are used in decision making and loops.
        // > , < , >= , <= , == , !=

        //4. Java Logical-Operators
        //Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false.
        // They are used in decision-making.
        //Logical AND(&&) , Logical OR(||) , Logical NOT(!)

        //5. Java Unary-Operators
        //Unary operators are used with only one operand.
        //++	Increment operator: increments value by 1 (++a , a++ Just like in C)
        //--	Decrement operator: decrements value by 1 (--a , a-- Just Like in C)
        //!	Logical complement operator: inverts the value of a boolean

        //6.Java Bitwise and Shift Operators
        //In Java, bitwise operators perform operations on integer data at the individual bit-level.
        //|	Bitwise OR
        //&	Bitwise AND
        //^	Bitwise XOR
        //~	Bitwise Complement
        //<<	Left Shift
        //>>	Signed Right Shift
        //>>>	Unsigned Right Shift
